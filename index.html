      <h2>About the competition</h2>
      <p>The International Aerial Robotics  Competition (IARC) is the longest running university-based robotics competition  in the world. It began in 1991 on the campus of the Georgia Institute of  Technology and is now in its 26th year. The seventh mission began in 2014 which poses three new challenges to the participants: (1) interaction  between aerial robots and ground robots; (2) no external navigation systems;  (3) interaction with other aerial robots.</p><br><br>
      <h2>About our team</h2>
    <p>We are the team THUBOT from Tsinghua  University, Beijing, China. Our team is divided into three groups: vision, simulation,  and control. The vision group is responsible for processing data from RGB-D  camera and laser. The simulation group establishes simulation platform which is  used for designing flying strategies. The control group aims to maintain a  steady flight for our robot. Every week each group works on their respective  tasks. Every Monday the entire team gathers for discussion and works to put the  parts together.</p></td>
